# 📈 Signal Formatter Modules for Prediction-Based Trade Alerts

Welcome to the official repository for the **Signal Formatter Modules**, a suite of Python tools built to bridge the gap between raw model outputs and live, risk-aware trading signals. This repo is designed for seamless integration into systems like **Codex** and live platforms such as **Telegram**, enabling clean, automated, and structured signal flow.

## 🚀 What This Repo Does

These modules convert model-generated predictions into fully-formed trade alerts with:

- ✅ Dynamic stop-loss and take-profit placement
- ✅ Validated risk-reward calculations
- ✅ ATR-based volatility filters
- ✅ Tiered confidence + leverage recommendations
- ✅ Auto-formatted signal output for Telegram

This system ensures **consistency, risk integrity, and automation readiness** for any model-driven signal environment — including **stocks, crypto, and forex**.

| Folder                      | Purpose                                                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `formatter/`               | Core formatter logic (SL/TP calc, leverage tiers, signal packaging) |
| `volatility/`              | ATR filters and volatility sanity checks                            |
| `dispatch/`                | Telegram output formatting and bot compatibility                    |
| `examples/`                | Sample signal inputs and expected output format                     |
| `docs/` (future)           | Google Docs–friendly guides for non-technical teammates             |

Each module is **independent but interoperable** — you can plug in only what you need or chain them for full pipeline output.

## 🔁 End-to-End Signal Flow

1. 🔮 **Prediction Engine** generates forecasted close prices and metadata
2. 🧮 **Formatter Module**:
   - Adds SL/TP
   - Calculates R/R
   - Recommends leverage
3. ⚠️ **Volatility Layer**:
   - Checks ATR range
   - Flags invalid signals
4. 📤 **Telegram Formatter**:
   - Converts output into clean HTML/Markdown-ready text
5. 🤖 *(Optional)* **Dispatcher Bot** sends to Telegram

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

Before this system, many signals lacked:
- Proper stop-loss definitions
- Validated reward expectations
- Transparency around risk
- Alignment with prediction timeframes

This repo **solves that** with reusable tools and clean interfaces so your trading system becomes scalable, compliant, and easier to trust.
